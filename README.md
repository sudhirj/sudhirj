#### Hello. I'm making it easy to build apps that work great with a handful to millions of users, with running costs that start at zero and go up linerarly with usage. Check back here for progress. 

I work as a technical architect and engineer with small teams that want to better use the cloud and modern tech to accomplish what they need to do. Contact me at sudhir.j@gmail.com if you need help.

If you're writing code in Go and want a simpler interface over DynamoDB, check out https://dbProject.RED 

If you're trying to represent Indian currency and can't figure out what the odd conventions are for lakhs and crores, check out [`paisa.rb`](https://github.com/sudhirj/paisa.rb) and [`paisa.js`](https://github.com/sudhirj/paisa.js). 

I also procrastinate on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/73831/sudhir-jonathan) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sudhirj).
